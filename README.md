# Eth-Maintenance
Developers tools to enable preventive and reactive maintenance of industrial grade machine using iot devices, sensors and Ethereum blockcahin, Web3 ecosystem tools. 

Execution: Preventive, Proactive and Reactive Maintenance, Refurbishment of industrial grade machine on Ethereum blockchain using UMA, Scroll,  Polygon zkevm, Uniswap, Tableland, Filecoin, XMTP, Web3 Ecosystem tools.

There are 2 key features of our solution:

1. Web3 Transform: For  digitizing maintenance pipeline forms, analyzing data, and automating maintenance workflows. 

2. Web3 Monitor Anaywhere: For developers building cross-platform monitoring dapps using sensors and oscilloscope with low code while retaining dapp core principles and flexibility.

# Blockchain eco-system   

UMA: We are using UMA's KPI options + Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets factory users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending UMA’s KPI Options with Superfluid’s streaming tokens: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating.

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, precision maintenance. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

To develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for machine monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools. Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAO.
