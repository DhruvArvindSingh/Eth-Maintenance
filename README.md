# Eth-Maintenance
Developers tools to enable preventive and reactive maintenance of industrial grade machine using iot devices, sensors and Ethereum blockcahin, Web3 ecosystem tools. 

Execution: Preventive, Proactive and Reactive Maintenance, Refurbishment of industrial grade machine on Ethereum blockchain using UMA, Scroll,  Polygon zkevm, Uniswap, Tableland, Filecoin, XMTP, Web3 Ecosystem tools.

There are 2 key features of our solution:

1. Web3 Transform: For  digitizing maintenance pipeline forms, analyzing data, and automating maintenance workflows. 

2. Web3 Monitor Anaywhere: For developers building cross-platform monitoring dapps using sensors and oscilloscope with low code while retaining dapp core principles and flexibility.

# Blockchain eco-system   

UMA: We are using UMA's KPI options + Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets factory users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending UMA’s KPI Options with Superfluid’s streaming tokens: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating.

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, precision maintenance. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

To develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for machine monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools. Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAO.

Scroll: Scroll enables hyper scalability of the Ethereum network, leveraging roll-up technology and a decentralized data availability layer to increase efficiency and performance in the industrial iot ecosystem, all while reducing fees and latency. We are developing tools and plugins for the green credits platform for heavy industrial machines along with an alarm viewer dapp (please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1LOA4q6TXw6df7T40rYvNsp8F-FMpKKp1). The alarm viewer can be used in case a industrial machines' quarterly pollution check is due or has not been completed one week before the penalty set by the government authorities. This alarm viewer can be further extended by the developers to build community tools, analytics and visualization tooling by adding features like pollution check performance ratings and raising alarms and notifications when the registry of an industrial machine to operate in a region expires (example: 15 years for petrol fuel machines and 10 years for diesel fuel small scale machines in Delhi). The alarm viewer application can also be extended for the use case where the pollution testing equipment does not give optimal results, which is very much true when a machine has been used for more than 45,000 hours.


Polygon zkEVM Public Goods Track: We are using Polygon zkEVM to develop a platform where government authorities linked with Environment Ministy, Pollution Control department like Water Pollution Monitoring, check control department, Municipality portal can issue, manage and transfer credits of ratings earned by factory owners and their respective heavy industrial machinery via pollution checks, green fuel adoption in machines.
This is especially useful for heavy industrial machinery parts managed by the government for public goods delivery (Example: GeM portal goods in India) where co-incentives can be provided to contract organizations for good performance in pollution checks, green fuel adoption (switching away from diesel fuel to liquid hydrogen). The workflow is as follows:

- Industry/Machine role creation procedure; 
- Machines identification with NFC tags; 
- Create credits of ratings earned via pollution checks, green fuel assets; 
- Issue green credits for machines via pollution checks by Environment Ministry, Pollution Control department like Water Pollution check control; List green credits per heavy machine; 
- Handle multiple heavy machinery.
