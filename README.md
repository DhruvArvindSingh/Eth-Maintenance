## Chainlink and Polygon zkEVM Public Goods Track and Safe Account Abstraction SDK

We are using Chainlink VRF, Polygon zkEVM to develop a platform where government authorities linked with Environment Ministy, Pollution Control department like Water Pollution Monitoring, check control department, Municipality portal can issue, manage and transfer credits of ratings earned by factory owners and their respective heavy industrial machinery via pollution checks, green fuel adoption in machines.
This is especially useful for heavy industrial machinery parts managed by the government for public goods delivery (Example: GeM portal goods in India) where co-incentives can be provided to contract organizations for good performance in pollution checks, green fuel adoption (switching away from diesel fuel to liquid hydrogen). The workflow is as follows:

- Industry/Machine role creation procedure; 
- Machines identification with NFC tags; 
- Create credits of ratings earned via pollution checks, green fuel assets; 
- Issue green credits for machines via pollution checks by Environment Ministry, Pollution Control department like Water Pollution check control; List green credits per heavy machine; 
- Handle multiple heavy machinery.

## Safe Account Abstraction SDK, Chainlink Functions and Automation, Polygon zkEVM: 
 
- ZK Incident Witness Generation tool for Eth-Maintenance using Safe Account Abstraction SDK and Polygon zkEVM: We are developing ZK Incident Witness Generation tool for machinery maintenance using Safe Account Abstraction SDK and Polygon zkEVM. Account Abstraction SDK enables customization of verification logic via plugins with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet dapp on Polygon zkEVM. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs. 

Implementation areas of Account Abstraction plugins:

Enforcing a spending limit for vital machine assets based on the key used for the transaction.

Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.

Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time.

Attestation Hub Contract for Machine Incident Reports: We are extending the Attestation Station smart contract to develop the Attestation Hub smart contract for Machine Incident Reports.

Gasless Transactions: Giving free transactions to citizen developers, journalists, volunteers sharing anonymized report or incident data of industrial plants: We are extending OpenGSN to enable 0 transaction fees for volunteers sharing anonymized report data using PyTorch or Scikit libraries.

# Filecoin and Tableland

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, precision maintenance. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

To develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for machine monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools. Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAO.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAOs:

DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp.
Service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. 
Service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.
Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before.

# UMA

We are using UMA's KPI options + Superfluid as a token streaming protocol that lets factory users and consumers create streams of tokens fluidly between addresses. This will enable effective incentivization, management and communication setup for service/repair organizations utilized in Operations and Maintenance. We are extending UMA’s KPI Options with Superfluid’s streaming tokens: Perpetual Conditional Rewards (PCR) tokens that combine Superfluid’s programmable cashflows with UMA’s KPI option concepts. Service Users and administrators would receive immediate benefits and feedback based on how that KPI was doing. Immediate feedback like this would be highly motivating.

# Scroll

Scroll enables hyper scalability of the Ethereum network, leveraging roll-up technology and a decentralized data availability layer to increase efficiency and performance in the industrial iot ecosystem, all while reducing fees and latency. We are developing tools and plugins for the green credits platform for heavy industrial machines along with an alarm viewer dapp (please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16BHWrIdMPE8emH2FpOWo7YaivIl4ge_F) (Screencast 1, 2 and 3)

The alarm viewer can be used in case a industrial machines' quarterly pollution check is due or has not been completed one week before the penalty set by the government authorities. This alarm viewer can be further extended by the developers to build community tools, analytics and visualization tooling by adding features like pollution check performance ratings and raising alarms and notifications when the registry of an industrial machine to operate in a region expires (example: 15 years for petrol fuel machines and 10 years for diesel fuel small scale machines in Delhi). The alarm viewer application can also be extended for the use case where the pollution testing equipment does not give optimal results, which is very much true when a machine has been used for more than 45,000 hours.
